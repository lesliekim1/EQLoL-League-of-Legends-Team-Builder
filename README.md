# EQLoL-League-of-Legends-Team-Builder

EQLoL: League of Legends Team Builder is a team builder web application for the game [League of Legends](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/). Its purpose is to help players explore champions, builds, and items, and create and share team compositions with the community. EQLoL is designed for League of Legends players of any rank and skill who are already familiar with the game.

**Note:** This project is a simplified team builder app. It includes a limited set of champions (instead of 170+), and each build is represented by three core items (instead of six) and one main rune (instead of a full rune path).
